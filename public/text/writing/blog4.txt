Im in Malawi by lake malawi
And I had this feeling come over
Of surreal experience, as if something had taken my feelings
As if I had lost my humanity
and gained space, awareness
Looking for signs that could be pointing towards powers and energies that 
are around us and controlling
I feel fearful
I trust that it will pass
In some ways I enjoy it. This feeling of apathy and fear and stiffness and comfort
not quite comfort, but no need to change
a kind of mission
an interest in a new domain
new way of being, seeing, experiencing
I wonder
I learned of a woman who gave her daughter rat poison to keep her sick in bed
The feeling to be needed by someone

2.
do something about your situation
we are these bodies
wielded in accordance with our will or perhaps the will of others sending a message
a medium for movement
a need
to cleanse the body
where have I gone and went
I don’t feel the truth anymore
blank
like something could control
yet I’m curious
In this world I looked at a friend and her face was so vibrant
so in focus
everything in visceral focus
a movie scene
not understanding how I got where I got
where we all were. Who I had become
not blackout but disoriented
an energy, confusion, interest, inquiry
I scared a friend by telling them this, explaining to them
I wonder what this means
to engage with someone so monotonous, so devoid of any feelings
so unable to shift energy and respond respectfully

3.
a supernatural blast or energy would be unsurprising to me
a switch, a flip of the light I would understand
I would stand behind, I would feel responsible
but incapable of challenging
letting it happen to understand it
trust that I would come out on the other side
blind young immortality
energies in a place I don’t know

4.
I don’t know why the kids came to surround grab and harass
I can’t know but perhaps we offended
perhaps we were not received 
we a symbol of destruction to be silenced
I wonder
Energies of previous people
unfinished business or beings we could not know
the feelings move around, they come back
I feel as though I am beginning to return
I appreciate the time and the space given for me to feel this way in this world
the energy is different
confident, yet no feeling, no grounding
a single node in the world
a single piece of paper to be written
Open for action and command
to plead orders 
to plead a lack of control in the moment
a different reality
a different way of seeing
a meticulous energy crept into me
I see birds in the light switch
I wonder the color red
I wonder my friend who bestowed upon me the knowledge of the girl and the poison and the mom
Did she wish to lay a curse?
May this curse pass
I believe simply an energy
I hope I fear not
I fear
it may not leave
But I trust the message will deliver

5. 
I drank water to help
I am here again. Slowly, small
I am coming back to retake this body
I’m here again, I’m here I can listen
I’ve been listening, but I couldn’t respond I couldn't speak I couldn’t say anything
I felt like I shouldn’t say anything
there was space needed for something else
I feel weak
I feel small
but I feel present
I feel like my perception is returning
the high detailed texture lighting framing fading
naturally with no battle
I cannot be called upon by another, but I know that I am here in this moment
I know that I’m alive
I know nothing and something
I know that I’m tired
I think transitory

6. 
perhaps a breath will help
a new way of seeing and believing
a test, testament, a message, a symbol, a milestone
in my journey in my passage to the other side
to the next step
it must be understood that I cannot go as I am
that I am but a body, the body that acts and speaks is but a body and I live elsewhere
I live somewhere else in this world, but I inhabit this body that I do not know
I search for my feet
I feel warmth
I feel my face
sweat, my hair
I wonder
I feel impervious
I feel my knees and my legs
I feel my stomach, my neck, my arms
aching 
aching from being alone
being neglected in their role
not given the space and agency that they might need, they might want, they might desire to be true and full
returning the bond of the body
returning truth to relation
as a medium
as a process
as a being
a being is relation
Itself is nothing but a relation between
a pair
nothing, without anything else
I know that I am because I was and I will be
I hope because I wish and I hurt
I care because I have to
because I am but a relation between others
I object to nothing
it is your mind, it is outside, it is here
given, taken, left, unheard
you must be your closest listener
Delivered
