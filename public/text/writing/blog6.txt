Melody in black sharpie on a cardboard mailbox. Six boxes lined up together; one for each tenant. 
A brown crinkled package leaning like the last book on a bookshelf. 
Patiently waiting, crouching, confident that she will be received with love, or rather, so bountiful in love herself that any response she can hold, nurture.

Swiftly brought downstairs, the time-bomb is ripped open by impatient hands. 
Hurriedly searching, grasping for a handle to withstand the wave. 
A swell of memories still unwritten to the past. 
Earrings, a necklace, a letter burst open. 
No air left. 
You have drowned. 
Please wait to be reborn.

Numbed, overcast and adorned

Melody in black sharpie on a cardboard mailbox, yet to be replaced by the new tenants name. 
New city, new life, new home.
Arrival uncertain and inevitable. 
Colored and protected by a brown crinkled package.
